THEME:
For COVID-19 situation, our economical state is not stable. So, we are presenting a platform to solve this 
problem in an effective way.This platform will create opportunities within the safe areas for those people
who are not affected with COVID-19 and need jobs or want to provide jobs to keep the economical stream moving.



Implementation and Potential impact:
We are team TITANIA from Bangladesh . As we all know, Bangladesh is a developing country and a large number of people here are living under poverty line . This Corona virus has not only hit us on health issues but also on our
Economical development . Lockdown is not just a myth for these people . They had to go out to work everyday in order to feed themselves and their families . This is a huge risk for them as well as for  whole country due to this ongoing pandemic .
It was not possible to make them stay at home and maintain self isolation .However, not only Bangladesh but also most of the world is facing this problem right now. So, we team TITANIA have decided to solve this problem with our
web platform named HOPE-19 . In the mean time we realized that this platform has impacts on environment as well . We are offering a culture where we are avoiding social gathering and high fuel consumption . This impact can bring a
better and safer environment for us and for the next generations.
